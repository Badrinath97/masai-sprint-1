                <p>According to Chase Craig, who was a member of Tex Avery's cartoon unit and later wrote and drew the first Bugs Bunny comic Sunday pages and Bugs' first comic book; "Bugs was not the creation of any one man but rather represented the creative talents of perhaps five or six directors and many cartoon writers. Happy Rabbit, a hare with some of the personality of Bugs (though looking very different), made his first appearance in the cartoon short Porky's Hare Hunt, released on April 30, 1938. Co-directed by Ben Hardaway and an uncredited Cal Dalton (who was responsible for the initial design of the rabbit), this short has an almost identical plot to Tex Avery's Porky's Duck Hunt, which had introduced Daffy Duck. Hare Hunt replaced the little black duck with a small white rabbit. Porky Pig was again cast as a hunter tracking a silly prey who is more interested in driving his pursuer insane and less interested in escaping.</p>

                <h3>How he was named!</h3>
                <p>Virgil Ross, the animator for A Wild Hare describes how the character came to be named in the interview published by Animato! magazine #19.Mel Blanc often told the story of the creation of the character and its name. He suggested that the character be named after the character's initial director, Ben "Bugs" Hardaway.Hardaway inadvertently christened him when his casual sketch of a proposed rabbit character was labeled “Bugs’s Bunny” by a fellow employee.Robert McKimson drew the model sheet for the character, Freleng developed Bugs’s personality, Avery and Jones made further refinements, and Blanc infused him with his familiar wisecracking Brooklynese delivery. Embryonic versions of the character appeared in Warner cartoons as early as 1938, but not until A Wild Hare (1940)</p>
